# This is the template for Spatial ABM for School Reopening

This repository contains our files for or simulation of our research paper: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2770172. Currently all our work is done in an exploratory notebook, but the methods are written and described. Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/bew030/domain_project_template/blob/main/notebooks/Example%20Notebook.ipynb). A visualization of our findings can also be found [here](https://github.com/bew030/domain_project_template/blob/main/src/visualization/png_to_gif%20(1).gif). Our goal is to get everything into a runnable python file in the future.


# Overview 
_Created by Bernard Wong and Ziqian Cui_

COVID-19 has drastically changed the way we live our lives. As of October 2020, there have been 45.5 million cases in the world and around 1.19 million deaths, making it one of the worst epidemics in history. There have been large efforts made in order to slow the spread of the disease and a lot of research is being done to find a vaccine. However, until a vaccine is created, it’s important to understand how the virus works and how it spreads in order to prevent future epidemics from happening. One of the largest industries affected by COVID-19 has been the transportation industry; as mandated quarantines were set around the world and more and more people became fearful of infection, the airline industry has lost nearly 314 billion USD. New research supports airborne transmission being one of the largest factors of the spread of the disease, and with public transports generally being small areas with recirculating air, it’s important to understand how the virus is spread and how air conditions can affect it. In doing so we can set effective guidelines that enable air to be cleaner and prevent the spread of these respiratory droplets, thus minimizing the transmission of COVID-19.
