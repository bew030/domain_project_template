# This is the template for Spatial ABM for School Reopening

This file is a general skeleton for spatial ABM for school reopening. No legitimate is included; however, the general idealogy is written down for how this project might be organized. Ideally, config would have the initial example data, notebooks would have an overview notebook, reference would have references, src would include the beef of the code, and run.py would be the final piece that the user would have to run to test the agent based model.
